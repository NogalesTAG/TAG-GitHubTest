# Coding Challenge 2 - Fibonacci Sequence Debugging

## Description
The Fibonacci sequence is a famous series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
It starts like this:

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...`

The first number is 0, the second is 1, and every subsequent number is calculated as:

`next = previous + one_before_previous`

Below is a piece of pseudocode intended to print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
However, it contains **three errors** (both syntactical and logical).

Your task is to:

- Identify and correct the errors.
- Make the code run properly.
- Print the full Fibonacci sequence (including the first two numbers) up to the 10th value.

You may use any programming language of your choice (C++, Java, Python, C#, etc.).

## Requirements
- Fix the given pseudocode to correctly generate and print the Fibonacci sequence.
- The program should print 11 numbers in total (from 0 to the 10th Fibonacci number).

## Input
The program receives no direct input.

## Output
```
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
55
```

## Constrains
- Use only basic control structures (loops, variables, print statements).
- You must not use built-in Fibonacci or recursive functions.
- The code should work for any n > 0 if modified easily.
